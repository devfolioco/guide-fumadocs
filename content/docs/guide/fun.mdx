Welcome to Devfolio! This help documentation will help you navigate everything you need to make the most out of the Devfolio platform. We highly recommend checking out the different sections applicable to you.

As a general rule of thumb, this documentation should help you navigate any problems or issues that may arise while using the platform. We encourage you to go through the relevant sections of your experience at least once to ensure that you're following all the steps perfectly.

However, in the off chance that you are unable to troubleshoot the issue yourself, you can reach out to us at [hello@devfolio.co](mailto:hello@devfolio.co). If you are part of an offline hackathon, you can also reach out to any Devfolio staff member that's available on ground. Our usual response times over email range from 12-24 hours.

We hope you have a great time using Devfolio. And remember, Never Stop Building ⚒️

## 🤹🏻‍♂️ Devfolio for Organizers

Devfolio is the result of a need for intuitive tools to manage community hackathons like [ETHIndia](http://ethindia.co/), [wmn;](https://wmn.community/) and [InOut](http://hackinout.co/) (7 editions so far) handcrafted and organized by the Devfolio team. And now we’d like to enable other hackathons as well to get to the next level with access to similar resources and our platform.
